    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Over the past century the <a href="https://www.iop.org/">Institute of Physics</a> (IOP), which publishes Physics World, has strengthened the case for physics by highlighting the many 
        benefits that the discipline brings to society.
         Those advantages include not just technological developments but education too, both of which allow physicists to apply their knowledge and skills to understand and improve the world.
          However, training a person to “think like a physicist” requires time, effort and a supportive environment, which is why strengthening physics teaching in schools and boosting diversity are so important.</p>
        
        </br>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">While the foundations of physics knowledge are usually established at school, it is at university that physicists really gain the skills that they need for a successful career in academia or industry.
         Such skills are a mix of the highly technical – for example, advanced computer simulations – and the generic such as communication and team-working skills. So, to train the next generation of physicists as best as we can,
          it is essential we understand not just how students learn but how students learn physics too.</p>

    <b>Stanford University</b>, officially <b>Leland Stanford Junior University</b>, is a private research university in Stanford, California. The campus occupies 8,180 acres, among the largest in the United States, and enrolls over 17,000 students. Stanford is ranked among the best universities in the world by academic publications.

    Stanford was founded in <b>1885</b> by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year. Leland Stanford was a U.S. senator and former governor of California who made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. The school admitted its first students on October 1, 1891,
     as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. Stanford University struggled financially after the death of Leland Stanford in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Following World War II, provost Frederick Terman supported faculty and graduates' 
     entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as Silicon Valley.

   <b>Harvard University</b> is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Established in <b>1636</b>and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, Harvard is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and among the most prestigious in the world.

    The Massachusetts colonial legislature authorized Harvard's founding, "dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches, when our present ministers shall lie in the dust"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century, it had emerged as the central cultural establishment among the Boston elite.
     Following the American Civil War, President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II; he liberalized admissions after the war.

    <b>The California Institute of Technology</b> (Caltech) is a private research university in Pasadena, California. The university is known for its strength in science and engineering, and is one among a small group of institutes of technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences.

Caltech was founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in <b>1891</b> and began attracting influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1920.
 In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán.

   <b>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b> (MIT) is a private land-grant research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Established in <b>1861</b>, MIT has since played a key role (MIT150) in the development of modern technology and science, ranking it among the most prestigious academic institutions in the world.

    Founded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.
